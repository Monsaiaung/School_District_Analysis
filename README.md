The purpose of the analysis is remove school data that have some evidences of academic disonesty. The grades that have been altered were math and reading scores of ninth graders in Thomas High School. In order to upload state-testing standards, the math and reading scores of ninth graders in Thomas High School will be replaced with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data. Then a report will be written to show how the clean-up affected the overall analysis. 

## Deliverables

- Deliverable 1: Replace ninth-grade reading and math scores
- Deliverable 2: Repeat the school district analysis
